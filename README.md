# Asymptotic Analysis as an Abstract Interpretation

This project is an implementation of asymptotic analysis of polynomials. Our preprint in this topic analyzes this analysis as an instance of abstract interpretation, and proves the soundness of the algorithm implemented in the `asymptotic.py` file.
